                Kimetsu no Yaiba (鬼滅の刃, The Demon Slayer Sword), known in English as Kimetsu no Yaiba: Guardians of the Night or Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, is a manga and anime series to which this wiki is entirely dedicated. It is a work by Koyoharu Gotoge that was published weekly in the pages of Shūkan Shōnen Jump magazine by Japanese publisher Shueisha. It follows the adventures of Tanjirō Kamado, a teenager whose family was cruelly killed by a demon who turned his sister Nezuko into one of these creatures, forcing Tanjirō to embark on a journey to hunt them down and help his sister regain her humanity.

                <br>
                The series is set in early 20th century Japan at the height of the Taishō era. There is a legend that mentions that strange creatures attack people at night and then eat them. Tanjiro Kamado is a young man from a poor village somewhere in the mountains of Japan far from civilisation who, after the death of his father, becomes the man of the house, caring for his mother and younger siblings while supporting his family by selling charcoal.
