                Neon Genesis Evangelion (新世紀エヴァンゲリオン Shin Seiki Evangerion?), also known simply as Evangelion, or Eva, is an anime series created by the Gainax studio and directed by Hideaki Anno. The story takes place in a futuristic world in which a paramilitary organisation called NERV protects humanity from attacks by beings of unknown origin and nature, the "Angels", using humanoid bio-mechas called Evangelion (shortened to EVA). As the plot progresses, it gradually becomes more confusing and psychological, where the characters' personalities become increasingly unstable and their development becomes pivotal. Hideaki Anno, the director and screenwriter, has said that the development of the series was inspired by his own experience, whereby the characters show a wide range of their emotional afflictions and personalities.

                Death Note (stylized as DEATH NOTE ) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light Yagami, a teenage genius who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to Shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. The series focuses on Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of people he considers immoral and to create a crime-free society, using the alias of a divine vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, led by the enigmatic Detective L, to stop him. Death Note was published in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump manga magazine from December 2003 to May 2006. Its 108 chapters were collected in 12 tankōbon volumes.
