                Neon Genesis Evangelion (新世紀エヴァンゲリオン Shin Seiki Evangerion?), also known simply as Evangelion, or Eva, is an anime series created by the Gainax studio and directed by Hideaki Anno. The story takes place in a futuristic world in which a paramilitary organisation called NERV protects humanity from attacks by beings of unknown origin and nature, the "Angels", using humanoid bio-mechas called Evangelion (shortened to EVA). As the plot progresses, it gradually becomes more confusing and psychological, where the characters' personalities become increasingly unstable and their development becomes pivotal. Hideaki Anno, the director and screenwriter, has said that the development of the series was inspired by his own experience, whereby the characters show a wide range of their emotional afflictions and personalities.
